This repository contains files that I have made that can be used to help work with webpages.
## `images.js`

`images.js` contains JavaScript functions that you can use to work with images.
### Contents
#### `showOnClick()`
The `showOnClick()` function listens for when an element is clicked, and then shows an image. Here's how to use it:
```javascript
showOnClick(imageId,otherItemId)
```
This listens for when the element with an id of `otherItemId` is clicked and displays the image.
